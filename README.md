# Project_ADV_ENGR

Milestone 1 :

- Convert DataBase into tf-idf matrix using pandas and a list of keywords for bugs
- Convert json files into a dataframe in order to use it for classification later on
- Starting to implement supervised learning method xGboost using a python library

Milestone 2 :

- Knn using only bugword doesnt seems to work great
- Use whole vocabulary and implement following classification methods :

  - Add of NB Multinomial Methods
  - Add of LinearSVC Methods
  - Add of DecisionTree model

- Starting to implement Neural Network using Tensorflow

Milestone 3 :

- Adapting Neural Network layer and number of perceptron in order to find the best accuracy
- Identifying keywords of each category found using Machine Learning
- Use of World cloud to show the words
